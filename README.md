# Student Database Management System
### This program is a simple student database management system that allows the user to add, search, update, and delete student records. 
### The program uses a LinkedList to store the student data, a TreeMap to perform search operations, and a HashMap to quickly access the data. 
### The program uses a while loop to repeatedly display a menu of options to the user and prompts them to enter information or make a selection. 
### The user can add student records by entering their name, surname, age, school name, and grade. 
### They can search for a student record by entering a name, and the program will search for the record in both the TreeMap and the HashMap and display the result. 
### The user can also update or delete a student record by searching for it and providing new information or confirming the deletion. 
### The program uses the Scanner class to read input from the user.
